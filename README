*Program Description / Instructions*
    This program is a simple review system (Like a reduced version of the UVA CourseForum). You will be
    able to create and use an account in order to add and view reviews in the system.

    To login, please run the HelloApplication class (NOTHING ELSE)

    Upon entering you will face a login window that will allow you to either login into an existing account or
    create a new account. The credentials needed to login are a username and password, and account creation will
    require password verification.

    After logging in, the user will enter the main menu page where three actions can be performed:
        * Creating a new review for a course
        * Viewing all reviews for a course
        * Logging out

    To create a new review for a course, a valid course must be entered which is an uppercase, up to 4 letter,
    string followed by a 4 digit number. If the course does not already exist, it will be added to the courses
    database and a review can be written for it, otherwise the review will be added to the pre-existing course.

    To view a course, a valid course must be entered which is an uppercase, up to 4 letter, string followed by
    a 4 digit number. If the course does not already exist or it has no reviews, the user will be alerted of
    no available reviews. However, if the course does have reviews, the bottom of the page will showcase the
    average course rating followed by the list of reviews anonymously.

    To logout, simply click the button on the main menu, and the user will be redirected to the original login
    page.

    Hoping for great reviews!
